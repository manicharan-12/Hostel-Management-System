# Hostel Management System

This project is a web-based Hostel Management System built with React.js for the front end and Node.js for the back end. It streamlines hostel operations by offering features such as:

- Real-time Room Availability Tracking: View vacant space in individual rooms and across floors, allowing for efficient room allocation.
- Student Management: Manage student information, including registration, details, and potentially room assignments.
- Multi-Level User Access Control: Implement a secure system with distinct roles like Admin and Super Admin. This grants access to specific features and functionalities based on user permissions.

This system provides a centralized platform for managing hostel resources and student data, improving efficiency and transparency.
